# Servo-motor-control-using-Hand-gesture
Rotate our servo motor when a hand gesture signal is made


INTRO
Hello guys. Welcome, in this video we are going to rotate a servo motor using hand gestures with the help of Python and of course Arduino.  
Using computer vision to track our finger movement, we send data to our Arduino to cause the motor to turn at an angle of 180 degrees. 
By tracking, the servo will only turn if the index finger is raised and the others are kept closed.
